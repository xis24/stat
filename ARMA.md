A time series Yt is said to be an ARIMA(p,d,q) process if âˆ†dYt is ARMA(p, q).For example, if log returns on an asset are ARMA(p, q), then the log prices are ARIMA(p, 1, q). An ARIMA(p, d, q) is stationary only if d = 0. Otherwise, only its differences of order d or above are stationary.
Notice that an ARIMA(p, 0, q) model is the same as an ARMA(p, q) model. ARIMA(p, 0, 0), ARMA(p, 0), and AR(p) models are the same. Similarly, ARI- MA(0, 0, q), ARMA(0, q), and MA(q) models are the same. A random walk is an ARIMA(0, 1, 0) model.
